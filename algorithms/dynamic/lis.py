# The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of
# a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
# For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and
# LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
