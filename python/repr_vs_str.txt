The default implementation is useless (it’s hard to think of one which wouldn’t be, but yeah)
__repr__ goal is to be unambiguous
__str__ goal is to be readable
Container’s __str__ uses contained objects’ __repr__

Summary

Implement __repr__ for any class you implement. This should be second nature.
Implement __str__ if you think it would be useful to have a string version which errs on the side of more readability in favor of more ambiguity.


My rule of thumb:  __repr__ is for developers, __str__ is for customers.
